Reproducibility in bioinformatics and computational biology 
========================

In computational biology, the problem of reproducibility refers to the challenge of ensuring that research findings, particularly those based on computational analyses and algorithms, can be reliably reproduced by other researchers. This issue stems from various factors:

- **Complexity of analyses**: bioinformatics often involves complex computational workflows, including data preprocessing, analysis, and interpretation. Small variations in parameters or input data can lead to significantly different results.

- **Dependency on software and tools**: bioinformatics analyses rely heavily on software tools and algorithms, which may lack standardization or documentation. Differences in software versions, configurations, or dependencies can affect reproducibility.

- **Data quality and availability**: bioinformatics studies often use large and diverse datasets, which may be incomplete, noisy, or poorly annotated. Inadequate data documentation or accessibility can hinder reproducibility.

- **Lack of standards and best practices**: there is a lack of standardized protocols and best practices for conducting and reporting bioinformatics analyses. This ambiguity makes it challenging for researchers to reproduce each other's work accurately.

- **Publication bias and incentives**: journals may prioritize novel and statistically significant findings over replication studies, creating incentives for researchers to prioritize novelty over reproducibility. This can lead to selective reporting and publication bias. We have a growing number of methods and very few papers aiming at comparing them.

To ameliorate this some tools are available:

- **Workflow managers** nextflow, snakemake, luigi, airflow
- **Linux containers:** docker, singularity, podman, apptainer
	- biocontainers
- **Virtual environments:** venv, conda, mamba
	- bioconda
- **Platforms for code sharing:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket 
- **Public repositories for scientific data:**  
        - Zenodo, Figshare
	- NCBI, ENA, PDB...


Introduction to Nextflow
========================
DSL for data-driven computational pipelines. `www.nextflow.io <https://www.nextflow.io>`_.

What is Nextflow?
-----------------

.. image:: images/nextf_groovy.png
  :width: 600

`Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io>`__ is a domain-specific language (DSL) for workflow orchestration that stems from `Groovy <https://groovy-lang.org/>`__. It enables scalable and reproducible workflows using software containers.
It was developed at the `CRG <www.crg.eu>`__ in the Lab of Cedric Notredame by `Paolo Di Tommaso <https://github.com/pditommaso>`__.
The Nextflow documentation is `available here <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/>`__ and you can ask help to the community joining their `slack channel <https://join.slack.com/t/nextflow/shared_invite/zt-11iwlxtw5-R6SNBpVksOJAx5sPOXNrZg>`__. 

In 2020, Nextflow has been upgraded from DSL1 version to DSL2. In this course, we will use exclusively DSL2. It is currently developed and maintained by the company `Seqera Labs <https://seqera.io/>`__ a spin-off from the CRG. Each year there is a special event about Nextflow called `Nextflow summit <https://summit.nextflow.io/>`__.

What is Nextflow for?
---------------------

It is for making pipelines without caring about parallelization, dependencies, intermediate file names, data structures, handling exceptions, resuming executions, etc.

It was published in `Nature Biotechnology in 2017 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28398311/>`__.

.. image:: images/NF_pub.png
  :width: 600

A search for Nextflow in Google Scholar gives you about 15,000 results. Many research groups from public centers and companies have adopted this framework for writing their pipelines and methods. 

Here you have a curated list of `Nextflow pipelines <https://github.com/nextflow-io/awesome-nextflow>`__. A community of researchers decided to go further and to build on top of Nextflow a framework for standardizing the pipelines. This ended up in a project called `NF-core <https://nf-co.re/pipelines>`__ that currently host 128 pipelines.



Main advantages
----------------


- **Fast prototyping**

You can quickly write a small pipeline that can be **expanded incrementally**.
**Each task is independent** and can be easily added to others. You can reuse scripts without re-writing or adapting them.

- **Reproducibility**

Nextflow supports many container technologies like Docker, Singularity / Apptainer, and Podman. Their use will make the pipelines reproducible in any Unix environment. Nextflow is integrated with **GitHub code sharing platform**, so you can call directly a specific version of a pipeline from a repository, download and use it on-the-fly.

- **Portability**

Nextflow can be executed on **multiple platforms** without modifying the code. It supports several schedulers such as **SGE, LSF, SLURM, PBS, and HTCondor** and cloud platforms like **Kubernetes, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud**.


.. image:: images/executors.png
  :width: 600

- **Scalability**

Nextflow is based on the **dataflow programming model**, which simplifies writing complex pipelines.
The tool takes care of **parallelizing the processes** without additional written code.
The resulting applications are inherently parallel and can scale up or scale out transparently; there is no need to adapt them to a specific platform architecture.

- **Facilitate sharing and collaborative coding**

Nextflow integrates the main code repositories such as BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab. Since each module / sub-workflow is independent, it is easier to code in parallel, reducing the bottlenecks.


- **Resumable, thanks to continuous checkpoints**

All the intermediate results produced during the pipeline execution are automatically tracked.
For each process **a temporary folder is created and is cached (or not) once resuming an execution**.

Workflow structure
-------------------

The workflows can be represented as graphs where the nodes are the **processes** and the edges are the **channels**.
The **processes** are blocks of code that can be executed - such as scripts or programs - while the **channels** are asynchronous queues able to **connect processes among them via input / output**.


.. image:: images/wf_example.png
  :width: 600


Processes are independent of each other and can be run in parallel, depending on the number of elements in a channel.
In the previous example, processes **A**, **B**, and **C** can be run in parallel, and only when they **ALL** end the process **D** is triggered. As you can see an operator is used for collecting or reshaping the output channels for generating a new one that is then consumed by the process **D**. 

Installation
------------

.. note::
  Nextflow is already installed on the machines provided for this course.
  You need at least Java version 17 for the Nextflow installation (see Nextflow `requirements <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html#requirements>`__).

.. tip::
  You can check the version for Java by typing::

    java -version

Then we can install Nextflow with:

  curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

This will create the ``nextflow`` executable that can be moved, for example, to ``/usr/local/bin``.

We can test that the installation was successful with:

.. code-block:: console

  nextflow run hello

	Nextflow 25.02.2-edge is available - Please consider updating your version to it

	N E X T F L O W   ~  version 25.02.1-edge

	Hola world!


This command downloads and runs the pipeline ``hello`` from the Nextflow official GitHub repository.


Nextflow main concepts
========================

Channels and Operators
-------------------------

There are two different types of channels:

- A **queue channel** is a non-blocking unidirectional `FIFO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)>`__ (First In, First Out) queue which **connects two processes or operators**.
- A **value channel**, a.k.a. singleton channel, is bound to a single value and can be read unlimited times without consuming its content.

An **operator** is a method that reshapes or connects different channels by applying specific rules.

We can write a very simple Nextflow script: save the following piece of code in a file called ``ex1.nf``. All the examples are in the folder
**/nextflow/examples/** while the scripts are in folders named **/nextflow/test**

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex1.nf
   :language: groovy

Once the file is saved, you can execute it with:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex1.nf

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `ex1.nf` [agitated_avogadro] - revision: 61a595c5bf
	hello
	hola
	bonjour


As you can see, the **Channel** is just a list of values, but it can also be a list of other elements such as **file paths**.

Let's create some empty files with the `touch` command:

.. code-block:: console

	touch aa.txt bb.txt cc.txt


and make another script (ex2.nf) with the following code:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex2.nf
   :language: groovy



We can now execute `ex2.nf`:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex2.nf

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `ex2.nf` [condescending_hugle] - revision: f513c0fac3
	/home/ec2-user/git/CRG_Nextflow_Jun_2022/nextflow/aa.txt
	/home/ec2-user/git/CRG_Nextflow_Jun_2022/nextflow/bb.txt
	/home/ec2-user/git/CRG_Nextflow_Jun_2022/nextflow/cc.txt


Once executed, we can see that a folder named **work** is generated. Nextflow stores in this folder the intermediate files generated by the processes.

In genomics, we often have a couple of files that have to be processed at the same time, such as the paired-end reads, etc. For this Nextflow allows using a special method for generating "tuples" from file pairs. 

We can simulate this situation by generating a couple of files:

.. code-block:: console

	touch aaa_1.txt aaa_2.txt

Then we use `fromFilePairs <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#fromfilepairs>`__ for generating a tuple (script **ex3.nf**):


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex3.nf
   :language: groovy

Executing it will show the emission of a tuple whose key is the common part of the two input files:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex3.nf 
	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 21.10.6
	Launching `ex3.nf` [reverent_ampere] - revision: 87d78a151f
	[aaa, [/nfs/users/bi/lcozzuto/aaa/CRG_Nextflow_Jun_2022/nextflow/examples/aaa_1.txt, /nfs/users/bi/lcozzuto/aaa/CRG_Nextflow_Jun_2022/nextflow/examples/aaa_2.txt]]


We can reshape the channels in several ways and/or cross them using `operators <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/operator.html>`_   so that they can be used for a particular purpose. In brief, each "emission" of a channel can be used by a process for a specific purpose.  
In the following example, we use the operator `mix <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/operator.html#mix>`_ for mixing together the elements of two channels:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex4.nf
   :language: groovy


.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex4.nf 
 	N E X T F L O W   ~  version 24.10.0

	Launching `ex4.nf` [pedantic_shockley] DSL2 - revision: dd437a0bb3

	hello
	hola
	bonjour
	/Users/lcozzuto/ooo/aaa_1.txt
	/Users/lcozzuto/ooo/aaa_2.txt
	/Users/lcozzuto/ooo/aa.txt
	/Users/lcozzuto/ooo/bb.txt
	/Users/lcozzuto/ooo/cc.txt


Exercise
-------------------------
Using again the previous 3 `.txt` files ("aa.txt", "bb.txt", "cc.txt"), reshape the channels to emit:

  - A single channel with a **single emission** with all the files
  - A channel with each possible file combination ( A vs A, A vs B, A vs C etc..)


See here the list of `Operators <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#>`__ available at the official documentation.

A special very powerful operator is **map**, that allows you reshaping the data in several ways. 
It uses the `Grovvy's closure <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/script.html#closures>`_ for modifying the input channel. In brief, a closure is a piece of code between curly brackets **{}** that can be passed as an argument of a function. It uses as input the implicit variable **it**:

Here you can see an example:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/map.nf
   :language: groovy

This will produce:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run map.nf
	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.03.0-edge
	Launching `map.nf` [irreverent_nightingale] DSL2 - revision: 48519e083e
	[my id, /Users/lcozzuto/aaa/ropes-linux-mop2-2023/nextflow/examples/aa.txt, /Users/lcozzuto/aaa/ropes-linux-mop2-2023/nextflow/examples/bb.txt]


.. Note::
	Each channel emission is asynchronous, or random, so you should not rely on the order if you don't assign an order to the channel using a sort operator. For instance, you can use the operator `**toSortedList** <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/operator.html#tosortedlist>`_ for ordering a channel.

	.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex5.nf
   	   :language: groovy


Processes
-------------

Let's add a process to the previous script `ex1.nf` and let's call it `ex1_a.nf`

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex1_a.nf
   :language: groovy



The process can be seen as a function that is composed of:

- An **input** part where the input channels are defined.
- An **output** part where we specify what to store as a result, that will be sent to other processes or published as final result.
- A **script** part where we have the block of code to be executed using data from the input channel, and that will produce the output for the output channel.

Any kind of code/command line can be run there, as it is **language agnostic**.


.. tip::
	Before the input, you can indicate a **tag** that will be reported in the log. This is quite useful for **logging/debugging**.


Workflow
------------

The code above will produce nothing (actually a warning) because it requires the part that will actually **call the process** and connect it to the input channel.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex1_a.nf
	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 22.04.3
	Launching `ex1_a.nf` [irreverent_leakey] DSL2 - revision: 224d75e0c7

	=============================================================================

This part is called a **workflow**.

Let's add a workflow to our code `ex1_a.nf`. Now we will have our first prototype of a Nextflow pipeline, so we can rename it `test0.nf`. You can find this code in **/nextflow/test0/** folder:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 34-37


We can run the script sending the execution in the background (with the `-bg` option) and saving the log in the file `log.txt`.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test0.nf -bg > log.txt


Nextflow log
================

Let's inspect the log file:

.. code-block:: console

	cat log.txt

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.08.1-edge
	Launching `test0.nf` [sleepy_perlman] DSL2 - revision: 203a1d860a
	[7b/235410] Submitted process > printHello (1)
	[f6/9fee82] Submitted process > printHello (3)
	[6b/094899] Submitted process > printHello (2)
	hello in Italian is ciao
	bonjour in Italian is ciao
	hola in Italian is ciao


We can add a **tag** to our processes: this will allow us to see, for instance, which is the input used by each process execution. You can run test0_a.nf where we introduce this code:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0_a.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 15


and obtain:

.. code-block:: console

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.08.1-edge
	Launching `test0.nf` [high_fermat] - revision: b129d66e57
	[6a/2dfcaf] Submitted process > printHello (hola)
	[24/a286da] Submitted process > printHello (hello)
	[04/e733db] Submitted process > printHello (bonjour)
	hola in Italian is ciao
	hello in Italian is ciao
	bonjour in Italian is ciao


At the start of each row, there is an **alphanumeric code**:

.. code-block:: console

	**[6a/2dfcaf]** Submitted process > printHello (hola)

This code indicates **the path** in which the process is "isolated" and where the corresponding temporary files are kept in the **work** directory.

.. note::
	**IMPORTANT: Nextflow will randomly generate temporary folders so they will be named differently in your execution!!!**

Let's have a look inside that folder:

.. code-block:: console

	# Show the folder's full name

	echo work/6a/2dfcaf*
	  work/6a/2dfcafc01350f475c60b2696047a87

	# List of files inside the folder

	ls -alht work/6a/2dfcaf*
	total 40
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff     1B Oct  7 13:39 .exitcode
	drwxr-xr-x  9 lcozzuto  staff   288B Oct  7 13:39 .
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff    24B Oct  7 13:39 .command.log
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff    24B Oct  7 13:39 .command.out
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff     0B Oct  7 13:39 .command.err
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff     0B Oct  7 13:39 .command.begin
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff    45B Oct  7 13:39 .command.sh
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff   2.5K Oct  7 13:39 .command.run
	drwxr-xr-x  3 lcozzuto  staff    96B Oct  7 13:39 ..


You see a lot of "hidden" files:

- **.exitcode**, contains 0 if everything is ok, and another value if there was a problem.
- **.command.log**, contains the log of the command execution. It is often identical to `.command.out`
- **.command.out**, contains the standard output of the command execution
- **.command.err**, contains the standard error of the command execution
- **.command.begin**, contains what has to be executed before `.command.sh`
- **.command.sh**, contains the block of code indicated in the process
- **.command.run**, contains the code made by Nextflow for the execution of `.command.sh`, and contains environmental variables, eventual invocations of Linux containers, etc.

For example, the content of `.command.sh` is:

.. code-block:: console

	cat work/6a/2dfcaf*/.command.sh

	#!/bin/bash -ue
	echo hola in Italian is ciao


And the content of `.command.out` is

.. code-block:: console

	cat work/6a/2dfcaf*/.command.out

	hola in Italian is ciao


You can also name the sub-workflows to combine them in the main workflow. 
For example, using this code you can execute two different workflows that contain the same process. As you can see the named workflows work similarly to the process: the input is defined by the **take** keyword, while the **script** part is represented by the **main**. We also have an equivalent of **output** that is **emit** that will be described later on. The following script can be found in `test0_b.nf` file


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0_b.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 23-28,35-40



We can add the **collect** operator to the second workflow that would collect the output from different executions and return the resulting list **as a sole emission**.

Let's run the code:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test0_b.nf -bg > log2
	
	cat log2

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `test0_b.nf` [irreverent_davinci] - revision: 25a5511d1d
	[de/105b97] Submitted process > first_pipeline:printHello (hello)
	[ba/051c23] Submitted process > first_pipeline:printHello (bonjour)
	[1f/9b41b2] Submitted process > second_pipeline:printHello (hello)
	[8d/270d93] Submitted process > first_pipeline:printHello (hola)
	[18/7b84c3] Submitted process > second_pipeline:printHello (hola)
	hello in Italian is ciao
	bonjour in Italian is ciao
	[0f/f78baf] Submitted process > second_pipeline:printHello (bonjour)
	hola in Italian is ciao
	['hello in Italian is ciao\n', 'hola in Italian is ciao\n', 'bonjour in Italian is ciao\n']



We can change the pipeline to produce files instead of `standard output <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html#process-outputs>`__. The script is named **test0_c.nf**.


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0_c.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 9,10,14,23,24,28
