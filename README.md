# Nextflow Course 2025 

Reproducible research and data analysis using Nextflow

## About the course

This slow-paced hands-on course is designed for absolute beginners who want to start using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) to achieve reproducibility of data analysis. 

### Outline

The course will train participants to build Nextflow pipelines and run them with Linux containers.

It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.



### Learning objectives

* Execute/Run a Nextflow pipeline.
* Describe and explain Nextflow basic concepts.
* Test and modify a Nextflow pipeline.
* Implement short blocks of code into a Nextflow pipeline.
* Use containers in Nextflow processes
* Develop a Nextflow pipeline from scratch.
* Run a pipeline in diverse computational environments (local, HPC, cloud).
* Share a pipeline.

### Prerequisite / technical requirements

Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.
Knowledge of containers is not mandatory. The course materials are online on the dedicated GitHub page for self-learning.

Having a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is recommended.
